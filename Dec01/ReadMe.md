# Day 1: Report Repair

## Part 1

Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your __expense report__ (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to __find the two entries that sum to 2020__ and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

In this list, the two entries that sum to `2020` are `1721` and `299`. Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer is __`514579`__.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. __Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?__

## Part 2

The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find __three__ numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to `2020` are `979`, `366`, and `675`. Multiplying them together produces the answer, __`241861950`__.

In your expense report, __what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?__
